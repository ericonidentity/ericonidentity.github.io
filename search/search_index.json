There are subsets of privileged security \u2013 Tier 0 effectively becomes the control plane, encompassing all existing Tier 0 assets, such as Active Directory and related systems such as Azure AD Connect and AD FS. Tier 0 now includes the Control Plane, which is highly privileged access that provides control over all resources. The credentials associated with the control plane are Global Administrator, and users that hold roles which can directly or indirectly obtain control over a Global Administrator. It has become important to include these accounts in that realm of Tier 0 access, as we tend to only focus on Global Administrator. As an example, Privileged Authentication Administrator roles can be used to reset authentication information on all accounts in a tenant. Intune Administrators, in a cloud-managed PAW deployment, become encompassed in Tier 0, as they can manipulate and manage PAW devices. Tier 1 becomes the Management and Data and Workload planes and still includes the Server Admin role; still privileged, but importantly still separated from the control plan and Tier 0. While the focus on the part of Microsoft is very cloud-oriented, privilege separation and the delineation are still critical for Active Directory, as well as using PAW for Active Directory management \u2013 majority of enterprises will still be leaning on Active Directory for a good while.

You need premium licensing when certain things are calling for MFA \u2013 such as per-user enablement (which is an O365 license thing), or more commonly thought of, conditional access. When Azure AD calls for MFA for WHfB enrollment, that MFA call is free. Considering that security defaults, which are also free, call for MFA potentially, this should be less of a concern.
