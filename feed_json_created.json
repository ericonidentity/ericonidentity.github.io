This recommendation has existed for about as long modern authentication and authorization systems have existed \u2013 over a decade now. Yet the reality is that there continues to be mystery shrouded around certificates, and sysadmins and developers still lean into using secrets.</p>\n<p>Secrets are problematic because they are nothing more than a password. Secrets are so much just a password that while Microsoft might refer to secrets as secrets in the UI for Entra, the underlying attribute name is passwordCredentials! While you can use systems like Azure Key Vault for secure management of who has access to the secrets, the reality is that secrets tend to be managed insecurely, both in transport and at rest. Identity Protection exists for workload identities, but it is not real time, and there are scenarios where it will not help you if the abuse is coming from inside the same trusted network.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s easy for organizations to determine what they are using with single-tenant applications, or if they are a developer of a multi-tenant app. A quick Microsoft Graph API call to applications/objectid of the application (app registration), and you can examine whether the application has certificates, secrets, or both assigned as credentials. You can also store credentials on the service principal, which I cover here, <a href=\"https://ericonidentity.com/2023/03/11/aad-app-registrations-and-enterprise-applications-the-definitive-guide/\">Entra App Registrations and Enterprise Applications: The Definitive Guide \u2013 Eric on Identity</a>.</p>", "image": null, "date_modified": "2025-11-28T21:13:44.429813+00:00", "date_published": "2025-01-13T00:00:00+00:00", "authors": [{"name": "Eric Woodruff"}], "tags": ["Entra ID"]}, {"id": "https://www.ericonidentity.com/2024/03/26/the-intersection-of-graph-and-entra-id-application-permissions-and-roles/", "url": "https://www.ericonidentity.com/2024/03/26/the-intersection-of-graph-and-entra-id-application-permissions-and-roles/", "title": "The Intersection of Graph and Entra ID: Application Permissions and Roles", "content_html": "<h1>The Intersection of Graph and Entra ID: Application Permissions and Roles</h1>\n<p>When you work someplace that develops software that interacts with Entra ID, the question of Graph permissions eventually comes up.

Folks in the industry may scan the headlines and believe that a mass cloud exodus is on the verge of happening, but we really need to look at what part of the cloud we are speaking to. We need to distinguish between IaaS, PaaS and SaaS, as well as related services and systems, such as IDaaS (identity as a service, aka Azure AD, Okta, and so on).</p>", "image": null, "date_modified": "2025-11-28T21:13:43.979438+00:00", "date_published": "2023-01-16T00:00:00+00:00", "authors": [{"name": "Eric Woodruff"}], "tags": ["Commentary"]}, {"id": "https://www.ericonidentity.com/2022/12/19/spaml-spoofing-users-in-azure-ad-with-saml-claims-transformations/", "url": "https://www.ericonidentity.com/2022/12/19/spaml-spoofing-users-in-azure-ad-with-saml-claims-transformations/", "title": "SpAML: Spoofing Users In Azure AD With SAML Claims Transformations", "content_html": "<h1>SpAML: Spoofing Users In Azure AD With SAML Claims Transformations</h1>\n<p>For those that believe SAML is dead, they should take a look at the Azure AD Application Gallery. While the authentication standard finished baking almost two decades ago, it\u2019s still a staple for integration of applications with Azure AD. As of writing, the Azure AD App Gallery has 2015 applications available for SSO integration, and 1335 of them use SAML, roughly two-thirds. Beyond this, there are thousands of line-of-business (LOB) and other 3rd party applications that don\u2019t exist in the gallery but leverage SAML. Many well-known applications and platforms are published in the gallery using SAML \u2013 Salesforce, Google Workspace/Google Cloud, AWS, SAP, Oracle Cloud, ServiceNow, Workday\u2026 the list goes on and on.</p>\n<p>With the ease of federated identity, not only are we tying other cloud providers to Azure AD, but we are also bringing in business critical applications. With this, we need to keep in mind that threat actors are not always targeting critical IT resources; one can do plenty damage with access to records and data stored within SaaS applications.</p>\n<p>Azure AD makes it easier than ever to spoof (impersonate) a user within a SAML response. This relatively easy technique allows us to impersonate a highly privileged user in the target application. At the same time, authentication behavior for all other users of the application, including the legitimate user being spoofed, will not change. If your organization leverages SCIM for user provisioning, which is the direction the industry is going, this lends in favor of spoofing going undetected, as optional attributes in the SAML response will go unused by the application.</p>\n<p>Within Azure AD, you do not need to be a Global Administrator to configure an Enterprise Application. Anyone with Application Administrator, Cloud Application Administrator, or assigned Owner to a specific application can manage it. From a usability perspective, Microsoft pushes delegation of ownership to the business units. The users, however, that now can manage the application, likely fall under the bar of PIM or any privilege separation. Suffice to say, this opens our potential pool of targets in an organization; needing Global Administrator for movement into target applications is not necessary, just whoever has ownership. Likewise, it\u2019s ripe for abuse by insider threats.</p>", "image": null, "date_modified": "2025-11-28T21:13:44.382839+00:00", "date_published": "2022-12-19T00:00:00+00:00", "authors": [{"name": "Eric Woodruff"}], "tags": ["Entra ID", "Security Research"]}, {"id": "https://www.ericonidentity.com/2022/12/02/field-notes-migration-from-federation-to-cloud-authentication/", "url": "https://www.ericonidentity.com/2022/12/02/field-notes-migration-from-federation-to-cloud-authentication/", "title": "Field Notes: Migration From Federation To Cloud Authentication", "content_html": "<h1>Field Notes: Migration From Federation To Cloud Authentication</h1>\n<p>During my stint at Microsoft, I spent a good deal of time with Windows Hello for Business (WHfB), and subsequently would be involved in prerequisite work to set the stage. For the enablement of WHfB, one of these items is device join, and it usually would be Hybrid Azure AD Join (HAADJ) for existing devices already within Active Directory. Device join can be a bit of a rabbit hole if the organization has federated authentication with AD FS in place, as there are different ways you can configure the device join process.</p>\n<p>One customer I was working with decided that they wanted to use their WHfB prerequisite work as the same point to switch from federated to cloud authentication with PHS; they were already sending their passwords to Azure AD for use with Azure AD Identity Protection. I discussed high-level what was required to switch but figured the conversation would continue after lunch. Instead, the customer decided to implement the switch during lunch, and their thousand or so users were moved to cloud authentication, with relatively little planning.</p>\n<p>Luckily their environment was relatively straightforward from an identity architecture perspective; I wouldn\u2019t recommend going into the switch without more thorough planning.

I saw some folks on Twitter commenting that this could be potentially a great tool for analysis for all sorts of commercial and public organizations, big and small. But do the recommendations from, and for, the Federal Government align to what most organizations really need?</p>\n<p>I\u2019ll be taking a look at each baseline policy as defined and providing analysis on it specific to the context of its applicability outside of government scenarios. I\u2019ll be going through in order as written, and then providing a final take.
