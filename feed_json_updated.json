This recommendation has existed for about as long modern authentication and authorization systems have existed \u2013 over a decade now. Yet the reality is that there continues to be mystery shrouded around certificates, and sysadmins and developers still lean into using secrets.</p>\n<p>Secrets are problematic because they are nothing more than a password. Secrets are so much just a password that while Microsoft might refer to secrets as secrets in the UI for Entra, the underlying attribute name is passwordCredentials! While you can use systems like Azure Key Vault for secure management of who has access to the secrets, the reality is that secrets tend to be managed insecurely, both in transport and at rest. Identity Protection exists for workload identities, but it is not real time, and there are scenarios where it will not help you if the abuse is coming from inside the same trusted network.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s easy for organizations to determine what they are using with single-tenant applications, or if they are a developer of a multi-tenant app. A quick Microsoft Graph API call to applications/objectid of the application (app registration), and you can examine whether the application has certificates, secrets, or both assigned as credentials.

While the authentication standard finished baking almost two decades ago, it\u2019s still a staple for integration of applications with Azure AD. As of writing, the Azure AD App Gallery has 2015 applications available for SSO integration, and 1335 of them use SAML, roughly two-thirds. Beyond this, there are thousands of line-of-business (LOB) and other 3rd party applications that don\u2019t exist in the gallery but leverage SAML. Many well-known applications and platforms are published in the gallery using SAML \u2013 Salesforce, Google Workspace/Google Cloud, AWS, SAP, Oracle Cloud, ServiceNow, Workday\u2026 the list goes on and on.</p>\n<p>With the ease of federated identity, not only are we tying other cloud providers to Azure AD, but we are also bringing in business critical applications. With this, we need to keep in mind that threat actors are not always targeting critical IT resources; one can do plenty damage with access to records and data stored within SaaS applications.</p>\n<p>Azure AD makes it easier than ever to spoof (impersonate) a user within a SAML response. This relatively easy technique allows us to impersonate a highly privileged user in the target application. At the same time, authentication behavior for all other users of the application, including the legitimate user being spoofed, will not change. If your organization leverages SCIM for user provisioning, which is the direction the industry is going, this lends in favor of spoofing going undetected, as optional attributes in the SAML response will go unused by the application.</p>\n<p>Within Azure AD, you do not need to be a Global Administrator to configure an Enterprise Application. Anyone with Application Administrator, Cloud Application Administrator, or assigned Owner to a specific application can manage it. From a usability perspective, Microsoft pushes delegation of ownership to the business units. The users, however, that now can manage the application, likely fall under the bar of PIM or any privilege separation. Suffice to say, this opens our potential pool of targets in an organization; needing Global Administrator for movement into target applications is not necessary, just whoever has ownership.
