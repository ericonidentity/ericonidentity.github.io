Since the primary focus of PAW is for privileged access, that means everything related to PAW needs to be encompassed within the same tier as privileged access.</p> <p>Microsoft documents this in their privileged access implementation documentation, and diagrams this out as follows:</p> <p></p> <p>Note Privileged Security highlighted in the red box. Image courtesy Microsoft.</p> <p>Those that are seasoned with Active Directory security may be more familiar with the Tiered access model, composed of Tier 0, Tier 1, and Tier 2, as diagrammed below:</p> <p></p> <p>The Active Directory oriented privileged access model.</p> <p>What is important to understand is that in the new model of privileged security, Tier 0 does not go away. There are subsets of privileged security \u2013 Tier 0 effectively becomes the control plane, encompassing all existing Tier 0 assets, such as Active Directory and related systems such as Azure AD Connect and AD FS. Tier 0 now includes the Control Plane, which is highly privileged access that provides control over all resources. The credentials associated with the control plane are Global Administrator, and users that hold roles which can directly or indirectly obtain control over a Global Administrator. It has become important to include these accounts in that realm of Tier 0 access, as we tend to only focus on Global Administrator. As an example, Privileged Authentication Administrator roles can be used to reset authentication information on all accounts in a tenant. Intune Administrators, in a cloud-managed PAW deployment, become encompassed in Tier 0, as they can manipulate and manage PAW devices. Tier 1 becomes the Management and Data and Workload planes and still includes the Server Admin role; still privileged, but importantly still separated from the control plan and Tier 0. While the focus on the part of Microsoft is very cloud-oriented, privilege separation and the delineation are still critical for Active Directory, as well as using PAW for Active Directory management \u2013 majority of enterprises will still be leaning on Active Directory for a good while. And speaking of Active Directory, for the organizations that have hybrid identity, where Active Directory and Azure AD are connected, organizations need to understand the paths of lateral movement and privilege escalation between the two identity providers; there are known attack paths where Active Directory can be leveraged to takeover Azure AD, as well as the opposite flow. These are just some examples, and role delineation and definition can be an article on its own \u2013 let me know if that would interest you. In the meantime, you can read about this evolution and how Microsoft defines it here, Securing privileged access Enterprise access model | Microsoft Learn.</p> <p>Both models are still widely used and the principles behind them are valid.
